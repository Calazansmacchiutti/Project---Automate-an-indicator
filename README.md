# Project Automate-an-indicator

Project Difficulty -> Train and create a complete project that involves the automation of a process done on the computer.

# Project Description:
You are an employee who works in a large clothing store chain with 25 stores scattered throughout Brazil.
Every morning, the data analysis team calculates the so-called One Pages and sends each store manager their One Page, as well as all the information used in calculating the indicators.
The One Page is a very simple and straight-to-the-point summary used by the store management team to know the main indicators of each store and allow both comparison between different stores, and which indicators that store was able to achieve or not achieve that day.
Challenge:
Your role, as a Data Analyst, is to be able to create a process as automated as possible to calculate the One Page of each store and send an email to each store manager with their One Page in the body of the email, and also the complete file with the data of their respective store attached.

# Technical Procedure:
At the end, your routine should also send an email to the board of directors with 2 rankings of the stores attached, 1 daily ranking and another annual ranking. In addition, in the body of the email, it should highlight which was the best and worst store of the day, and also the best and worst store of the year. A store's ranking is given by its sales.
The spreadsheets for each store must be saved inside the store's folder with the date of the spreadsheet, in order to create a backup history.

# File Map:
Emails.xlsx file with the name, store and email of each manager.
Sales.xlsx file with the sales of all stores. The information from another store should not be sent to the manager who is not from that store.
Lojas.csv file with the name of each store.
